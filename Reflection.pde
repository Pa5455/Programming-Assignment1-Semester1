/* Reflection

Name : Patrick Curran

Student Number: 05517834

Part A - Mark 4/5

Having review the rubric I would give myslef 80% here, I used single line and multiline comments and proper indentation throughout.
I used camelCase naming throughout and I think the naming I used makes it easy to follow, eg on line 40 I used drawCab() to describe 
the drawing of teh cab method.
Readme and reflection included. 

Part B - Mark 10/10

Set up() and draw() are fully working so in excellent mark range here. lines 14 and 33

Part C - Mark 10/10

I have multiple if statements (line 64,142,149,163,167,168) with multiple branches (lines 71,145,152,165,170,172) and
also nested ifs on lines 168)

Part D - Mark 20/20

I have while loop on line 95, I have a for loop on line 104 and a for inside a for on line 105(nested for). Gave myself 100% excellent for this.

Part E - Mark 19/20

I have 12 bespoke methods lines(52,60,80,86,90,101,111,117,123,131,140,163), they are called in lines (36-37 and 39-49). Picking out examples:
line 52 shows a method with no parameters and no return value (the void flasher() method which is the flashing beacon light on top of cab
line 117 shows a method with 4 parameters and no return value, it is called twice in line 45 and 46, close as I could get to overloading
line 80 shows a method with parameter and a return value (takes angle of bucket in rads and coverts to degrees return value)

I took a bit off this as my overloading is not really overloading, just the parameters change values rather than changeing type

Part F - Mark 20/20

I have called >3 than 3 processing methods, on lines (16,17,18,35)

Part G - Mark 15/15

Sting methods on lines 62,63,64,65 which are meaningful to the project. The tractor requires a name (using JOptionPane to use a user input dialoge box). 
In order to control the text to fit on the bonnet of the tractor a limit on the number of charactors was made, lets say requirment comes from 
marketing department. All caps should be displayed on the bonnet, dont want a space at start so trim used. 

Overall Mark
------------
4 + 10 + 10 + 20 + 19 + 20 + 15 = 98/100
